This repository is for the class ENEE 631 Digital Image & Video Processing in UMD, including web journals which contains implementation and discussion of basic image & video processing techniques, and the final project of which the topic will be decided later.

All the algorithms are impelemented in MATLAB and are organized to create web journal for each project.

The collection of all the HTMLs generated by these files can be found at http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~mzd95/ENEE631Projects.html.
